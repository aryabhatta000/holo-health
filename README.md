# holo-health
_**Person-Centric Healthcare Ecosystems**_ on top of a _holochain_ based infrastructure.

Code Status: **Pre-alpha Design**. Not for production use. This application has not been audited for any security validation.

## Goals
   1. Create _**empowered health marketplaces**_ that enable _HealthCare Providers_ to offer health services (both online and in-person) that can be easily discovered and privately subscribed to by individuals.
   1. Put _**individuals in charge**_ of their own **_healthcare data_** and their _**healthcare decisions**_.
   1. Enable _**better health outcomes**_ by unifying all of an individual's health observations into a single _**Personal Health Record**_ (PHR). Observations added by _**any healthcare provider**_ in my ecosystem are added to my _PHR_.
   1. _Design in_ direct support for compliance with relevant healthcare (e.g., HIPAA/HITECH) and personal information regulations (e.g., GDPR). 
   1. Support traditional _**currency-for-service**_ flows while also allowing an open-ended set of _agreement types_ to be used to support _**alternative reciprocal value flows**_ (e.g., _alternative currencies_, _barter_, or _gift economy_). 
   
## Additional PoC Goals   
   1. _**Showcase Holochain Capabilities and Design Patterns**_ This _Proof of Concept_ (_PoC_) is intended to serve as a learning vehicle for both its primary author and (hopefully!) other holochain application developers. This includes viewing hApp's as micro-services that may be composed and choreographed in different ways (as opposed to just monolithic point solutions). Also, design choices tend to favor holochain capabilities even in cases when, in a true production project, alternate solutions may be preferable.
   1. _**Encourage Collaboration.**_ Feedback and contributions from other members of the holochain community are welcomed!
